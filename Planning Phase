Welcome and Onboarding
  Create a "Welcome" Category
    #Welcome-rules: list server rules and add a reaction bot (probably Carl-bot) that requires any new useers to agree before accessing the rest of the server.
    #introductions: A place for new members to introduce themselves (probably use a template that we can develop in the future)

Music: I am still working on a bot that pulls from Youtube and Soundcloud
  This bot would allow links, Create queues(max 50 songs), Vote to skip, and create a radio-like effect with genres, artists, and more

Improve the text channel organization
  Expand the "Text Channels" section:
    #Gaming-Chat: For general gaming discussions that dont fit into our specific categories
    #Off-topic: For unrelated and general goblin behavior
    #Events-and-announcements: Read-only chat that announces any specific events (maybe host game nights or something)
    #Pets: Post your furry/scaley friends
    #Food: Post your sloppy steaks

Hosted Servers:
  I intend on spending 2025 hosting game servers this is where we would announce what we host, a place for mod requests/reccomendations, and feedback
    #Day-Z
    #Project-Zomboid
    #Valheim
    #Rust
    #Arma-III

Voice Channels: general/game specific channels with a couple alternates to cut down on crosstalk
    #General
    #vintage-story
    #project-Zomboid
    #Sea-of-Theives
    #Diablo


Bots:
  Currently we are using Euphony for music
  Other bots for engagement
    Triviabot: Gaming and general trivia
